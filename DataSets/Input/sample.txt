You can request the "untyped" view of a Dataset or access the RDD that is generated after executing the query. 
It is supposed to give you a more pleasant experience while transitioning from the legacy RDD-based or DataFrame-based APIs you may have used in the earlier versions of Spark SQL or encourage migrating from Spark Core’s RDD API to Spark SQL’s Dataset API.
The default storage level for Datasets is MEMORY_AND_DISK because recomputing the in-memory columnar representation of the underlying table is expensive. You can however persist a Dataset.
